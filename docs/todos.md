# TODOs

## Tomorrow's Agenda

### 1. Refactor: Hybrid Approach for Game State

Implement composite hooks to reduce boilerplate while maintaining performance.

**Tasks:**

- Create `useGameState(sessionId, roundNumber)` - wraps session + round + players + selections
- Create `useLobbyState(sessionId)` - wraps session + players
- Update Round screen to use `useGameState`
- Update Lobby screen to use `useLobbyState`
- Keep granular hooks (`useSession`, `useRound`, `usePlayers`, `useSelections`) for flexibility

**Reference:** See [docs/game-state.md](./game-state.md) for full details

### 2. Add Tests for Today's Work

Need test coverage for all new functionality added today.

**New Files to Test:**

- `useRound` hook - real-time round document subscription
- `useSelections` hook - real-time selections subcollection
- `advanceRound` function - closes current round, opens next, updates session
- `startSession` function - closes lobby, opens round 1

**Testing Pattern:**
Follow existing test structure in `src/db/__tests__/`:

- Mock Firestore functions (`onSnapshot`, `writeBatch`, etc.)
- Test success cases
- Test error handling
- Test state transitions

**Files to Create:**

- `src/db/__tests__/use-round.test.ts`
- `src/db/__tests__/use-selections.test.ts`
- `src/db/__tests__/advance-round.test.ts`
- `src/db/__tests__/start-session.test.ts`

### 3. E2E Multiplayer Testing Strategy

Figure out how to test multi-device interactions in a multiplayer game.

**Critical Flows to Test:**

- Host starts game → all players auto-navigate to round 1
- Host advances round → all players see new round
- Player makes selection → other players see completion status
- Multiple players join lobby → all see updates

**Approach Options:**

#### Option A: Mock Multiple Clients (Recommended for MVP)

- Spin up multiple Firebase instances in test
- Simulate host + 2-3 player clients
- Test state propagation through Firestore
- **Pros:** No external dependencies, fast, reliable
- **Cons:** Not testing real multi-device scenarios

#### Option B: Playwright/Maestro with Multiple Sessions

- Open multiple browser tabs/sessions (web)
- Or multiple simulator instances (mobile)
- Coordinate actions across sessions
- **Pros:** Real multi-device testing
- **Cons:** Slow, complex setup, flaky

#### Option C: Firestore Emulator + Test Bots (Best Balance)

- Run tests against Firebase emulator
- Create test "bot" utilities that simulate player actions
- Verify state changes propagate correctly
- **Pros:** Fast, reliable, good balance of real + testable
- **Cons:** Requires emulator setup

**Decision:** Start with **Option A or C** - fastest/most reliable for initial coverage. Add Option B for critical flows only if needed.

**Next Steps:**

- Draft testing utilities for simulating multiple clients
- Identify 3-5 critical multiplayer flows to cover
- Decide on tooling (Jest + mocked Firestore vs Emulator)
